Used Vicon for crazyflies hover with Rugved Katole : 25/05/24
1. We select objects by holding 'ctrl' and selecting the beads in 3D Perspective view
2. The app is Vicon Tracker
3. Did calibration using wand : pie chart on each camera shows if that camera is calibrated or not.
4. The cameras emit IR waves and the wwaves reflected from the grey beads. Even metal surfaces reflect IR waves so if any metal is in the vicon workspace it might cause error. Now this can be removed using mask.
5. To create new objects, first we'll have to untrack older objects
6.
